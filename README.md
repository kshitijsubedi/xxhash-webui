# A Web UI to generate xxHash from text input.

xxHash is an extremely fast non-cryptographic hash algorithm, working at RAM speed limit. It is proposed in four flavors (XXH32, XXH64, XXH3_64bits and XXH3_128bits). The latest variant, XXH3, offers improved performance across the board, especially on small data.
